# To-Do-List
A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do list—but just because you’ve written your 
to-dos down doesn’t mean your to-do list is actually useful. Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and get great work done. 
But too often, that list of work to-dos is disorganized and disconnected from the actual work you’re doing—which leads to less clarity and more work about work.
Sorting and prioritizing work. If you want to change the order of your written to-do list, you have to rewrite the whole thing. But with a to-do list app, you can easily drag and drop items.
Not only that—most to-do list apps offer a way to track priority with custom tags.
Digital to-do lists also allow you to set up recurring tasks, so you’ll never forget a weekly meeting again. Plus, to-do list apps support multiple views, so you can visualize your tasks the 
way that works best for you, be it in a list or a Kanban board.

Impossible to lose. Unlike a handwritten to-do list, you can’t “lose” an online to-do list. You’ll always have access to the list—whether on your desktop, iPhone, iPad, or other smart 
devices—so you can jot down to-dos wherever you are.

Add additional context to your to-dos. Most to-do list apps offer a way for you to add additional information in the description. In a written to-do list, all you have are a couple of words
to describe what you need to work on. But with a to-do list app, each to-do has an expandable description, where you can add any relevant task details, working docs, or important information. Plus, to-do list apps utilize integrations like Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Outlook, so you can attach documents and add context to your most important tasks.

Create separate lists in the same place. Before you choose a to-do list app, make sure you can create more than one “list” in the app. You might want to create a personal to-do list for your
work, another for your team’s work, and a third for your professional development, for example. Or, you may want to sort tasks by timeframe, such as creating a daily to-do list and a weekly 
to-do list. A to-do list app with multiple list options allows you to store all of these to-dos in one place.

Set reminders, due dates, and notifications. Your to-dos, whether for a “me” day or critical project deadlines, don’t mean much if they’re not done in time. With a to-do list app, you can 
track when work is due, and set reminders or customizable notifications to make sure you get your to-dos done in time.
